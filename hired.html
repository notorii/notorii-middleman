    Hired
  </h1>
  <p>
    In the summer of 2013, Developer Auction was facing a crisis of identity. The rapidly growing startup was expanding into recruiting beyond solely software developers, and needed a brand that was aligned with their business proposition and values.
  </p>
  <p>
  With the hired.com domain secured, notorii founder Harold Herbert was enlisted to create the new identity. Over a ten-week timeline, the brand was executed on all physical & digital mediums.

    Collateral
  </h1>
  <p>
  In the digital era, the value of high-end print collateral cannot be understated. We worked with local print craftsmen Dependable Letterpress, to develop a top of the line stationery using traditional print techniques. The weighty materials, de-bossed lettering, and textured paper stock created a memorable experience for the physical touch point of the brand.

  <h1>
    Interior Design
  </h1>
  <p>
  The interior design strategy of the new Hired offices was to create a visual continuation of the digital experience. Off-white was used as the dominant paint color, with the brand's charcoal gray brought into play to highlight the detailing of the metalwork in the building. Pops of color drawn from the palatte of the interface were realized through the use of bright accent furniture and foliage, maintaining the color proportions of the web platform.
