    Dropprice
  </h1>

  <p>notorii was initially engaged to redesign three pages for Dropprice, formerly GroupingMall. This extended to a redesign of the entire application, with a new brand and revised business model.</p>

  <p>We mapped a new information architecture, wireframed, and designed mobile, desktop, &amp; tablet mockups for each page. We documented an event-based analytics implementation to test our assumptions and provide data for further iterations &amp; improvement. Selected mockups are set out below.</p>
