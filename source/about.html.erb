<p>
  notorii is a multidisciplinary design firm.
</p>

<p>
  In a world of increasing visual clutter, thoughtful, clear, design solutions stand out from the noise. Building upon the work of the modernist masters, we strive to achieve longevity in design by application of the mantra <b>“less, but better”</b>. We believe in design by subtraction; more whitespace, fewer colors, and fewer typefaces.<sup class="reference"><a href="http://www.vignelli.com/canon.pdf" target="_blank">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
 Each project is treated with a holistic approach; the same level of quality and craftsmanship is applied to every touchpoint and medium.
</p>

<p>
Our capabilities include <b>product design</b>, <b>branding & identity</b>, <b>software development</b>, <b>advertising</b>, and <b>copywriting</b>. The proper design approach can be applied to any medium, and we work on a variety of creative projects.
</p>

<p>
We work with clients that state their problems clearly, and put their trust in us as designers to solve them.
