    Hired
  </h1>
  <p>
    In the summer of 2013, Developer Auction was facing a crisis of identity. The rapidly growing startup was expanding into recruiting beyond software developers, and needed a new brand to reflect their changing business proposition and company values.
  </p>
  <p>
  With the hired.com domain name secured, notorii founder Harold Herbert was enlisted to create the new identity. Over a ten week timeline, the brand was conceptualized and executed on all physical & digital mediums.
  </p>
  <p>
  Since the Hired launch, the company has grown to a $60 million valuation.

    Brand Manual
  </h1>
  <p>
  Driven by Hired's goal of becoming the source for the best talent and opportunities in the technology industry, we crafted a digital luxury brand.
  <p>
  Gotham was a logical choice as the company's typeface due to it's streamlined appearance, diversity of weights, and prcise webfont rendering. Loose letterspacing in the logotype and headers create a feeling of harmony and reverence.
  </p>
  <p> Light gray and charcoal background and text color reduce eye strain by lowering the contrast of the user interface. Braun's product design programme was the inspiration for the brand's interface colors; the functional connotations of each are universally recognized.

   UI Library
  </h1>
  <p>
  Hired's website is composed of a pure code interface utilizing SASS and icon fonts for a lightweight, scalable design. A full front-end library of reusable user interface modules was developed for rapid prototyping and development.

  <h1>
    Interior Design
  </h1>
  <p>
  The interior design strategy of the new Hired offices was to create a visual continuation of the digital experience. Off-white was used as the dominant paint color, with the brand's charcoal gray brought into play to highlight the detailing of the metalwork in the building. Pops of color drawn from the palatte of the interface were realized through the use of bright accent furniture and foliage, maintaining the color proportions of the web platform.

    Collateral
  </h1>
  <p>
  In the digital era, the value of high-end print collateral cannot be understated. We worked with local print craftsmen Dependable Letterpress, to develop a top of the line stationery using traditional print techniques. The weighty materials, de-bossed lettering, and textured paper stock created a memorable experience for the physical touch point of the brand.

  <!--Custom gift boxes were fabricated to give as gifts to talent hired through the platform. The dimensions of the packaging were made specific to the contents of a bottle of Dom Perigon, embossed moleskine, Hired tee shirt, and hand written note from a personal talent advocate.-->
