title: notorii - about
---

<p>
Back to simplicity, Back to purity.<sup class="reference"><a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/rw/about/good-design" target="_blank">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
notorii is a multidisciplinary design firm with a singular focus;
timeless design.

<p>We believe in more whitespace, fewer colors, & fewer typefaces. In a world where everyone is yelling, whisper.
</p>

<p>
  We despise the culture of obsolescence, the cult of the ephemeral.<sup class="reference"><a href="http://www.vignelli.com/canon.pdf" target="_blank">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
  We are Software Designers, taking equal pride in the quality and craftsmanship of both the user interface and codebase.
</p>

<p>
We have no office; our team is liquid, accumulating where necessary to overcome obstacles.
</p>
<p>
  We believe in working with clients that state their problems clearly, and put their trust in us as designers to solve them.</p>
